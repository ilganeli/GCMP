			<p>The Greek composer Manos Hadjidakis (1925-1994) is beloved worldwide for his compositions, which range from classical music to folk music to film music. His most famous composition, 1960’s Never On A Sunday, was composed for the film of the same title, and garnered him an Academy Award for Best Original Song. That song would go on to be his most famous, and would become the definitive sound of Greek music to an international audience for generations to come. But he wrote prolifically, both in Greece and in America, where he lived 1966 to 1972.</p>
			
			<p>Hadjidakis was deeply influenced by the American culture he loved — the cities, the life, the music, the artists. In turn, American musicians performed, adapted, and popularized his music through movies, musicals, concerts, and records. Today, twenty years after his death, a new generation is re-discovering his work, approaching it in innovative and exciting ways. This special concert will present the new Hadjidakis of the 21st century, who is still inviting us all to go with him "for a walk on the moon.”</p>
			
			<p>Composer, pianist, and improvising musician <strong>Michael Malis</strong> spearheads this concert in a program that will provide new adaptations of some of Hadjidakis’ best known compositions, as well as some of his lesser-known gems. Malis, who is of Greek-American descent, brings a unique perspective to this music. The program will be diverse, featuring a range of instrumentations, from solo piano to chamber ensembles. Malis will be joined by special guests, including multi-instrumentalist <strong>Michele Ramo</strong> (performing this evening on mandolin and guitar); flutist <strong>Ellie Falaris Ganelin</strong>, the founder of the Greek Chamber Music Project; and cellist <strong>Abigail Alwin</strong>, an improvising musician with a deep affinity for Greek music.</p>
			
			<p>Also featured on the program is Ann Arbor’s own <strong>OrnämatiK</strong>, a “Balkan funk band” featuring popular area musicians. Well known for their legendary festive performances around Ann Arbor, Southeastern Michigan, and across the Midwest, OrnämatiK consistently delights dancers and audiences alike.</p>

			<p><em>This concert is made possible with the support of the Modern Greek Program at The University of Michigan and in part by an award from the Michigan Council for Arts and Cultural Affairs.</em></p>
